# JavaScript

The `js/` folder gathers all JavaScript files (scripts, libraries, modules etcâ€¦).

The `js/app.js` file is the main js file that should be linked in your html with a `type="module"` attribute.

Alternatively the `js/script.js` file can be used alone (if not using modules) or with conjuction with the `js/app.js` file.

At the top of the `js/app.js` file, import any needed modules from inside the `js/modules` folder.
