# Abstracts

The `scss/abstracts/` folder gathers all SASS helpers used across the project. Variables, functions, mixins and placeholders should be put in here.

*This folder should not output lines of CSS when compiled.

## [Functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function)

`scss/abstracts/_functions.scss` contains all your functions.

The `ss-var($variable, $keys...)` function is used to access sass maps and nested maps values easily.

## [Mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin)

`scss/abstracts/_mixins.scss` contains all your mixins.

## [Placeholders](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend)

`scss/abstracts/_placeholders.scss` contains all your placeholders to be extended `@extend`.

## [Variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables)

`scss/abstracts/_variables.scss` contains all your variables and [SASS Maps](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps).
